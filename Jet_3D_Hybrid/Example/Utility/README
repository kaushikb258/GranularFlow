            tecplot -mesa 
       3. b_tecplot is alias to tecplot version 11.0 in a batch mode:

Tecplot Subdirectories
  Macro  files are located in subdirectory  Macro
  Layout files are located in subdirectory  Layout
  Style  files are located in subdirectory  Style
  Movie  files are located in subdirectory  Movie
  Figure files are located in subdirectory  Figure

Note : Edit the paths in the Marco file for the location of the 
       data files and output files.

---DATA Preparation--------------------------------------------------------

HERE assume that the data files are called fileheader_xxxxx.dat.  
xxxxx is some numerical number attached with the filename.
In the following example, the fileheader is SP_2D_Zico_.  It can be anything.

0.  Create two subdirectory  Flow and Particle

0.1 Move the particle data files *_p.dat into the Particle subdirectory 
      (mv *_p.* Particle)

0.2 Move the fluid data files *.dat into the Flow subdirectory 
      (mv *.* Particle)

0.3 Perform the following step 1-7 for both data files in the Particle and 
    Flow subdirectories.

1. Preplot all the data files by running the script
     goplot 
   or simply do it manually
     preplot SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.dat

   The .dat files will be moved to the temporary storage 
   in the subdirectory Data as soon as the corresponding plt files were created.

   The Shell script  deletedat can be used to remove the .dat file which were
   already been preploted.

  Note : Once the SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt file is created, 
              the SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.dat file can be 
         deleted or moved to other location for temporary storage.

  Note : Becareful to make sure that all SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt files are created 
         correctly before deleting the original data files.

2. Reorder the SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt files in the correct numerical order, 
   run the script
     reorder [n]
   where n (default 5) is an optional that determine the total number 
   of integers in the filename together with the padded zeros if needed. 

   For example, command
     reorder 4
   will generate a file SP_2D_Zico_0031.plt from a file SP_2D_Zico_31.plt.

3. Rename and sequencize all the SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt to Flow_n.plt, run script
     renumber [n]
   where n (default 1) is an optional argument that determine 
     the starting number.

   For example, command
     renumber 1000
   will generate the file Flow_1000.plt, Flow_1001.plt .... 
   from the files SP_2D_Zico_xxxx.plt in the same order 
   as appeared in the ls command.

4. As an alternative, run the script 
     filelist
   which will generate two script files Data_List and Flow_List.
   These two files take a snapshot of the current state of the plt files.
   They are also designed to rename the SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt to Flow_n.plt and vice
   versa.  Do not delete both files as it is almost impossible to recover
   the original filename SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt if both files are missing.

6. In additionally, the script
     create-rename 
   can be used to rename SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt to Flow_n.plt.

   WARNING : Use with extreme caution as the original filename 
               SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt will be lost forever.

7. Allternatively, the script
     create-link
   can be used to create a symbolic link from Flow_n.plt to SP_2D_Zico_xxxxx.plt.

   It is a safer approach than create-rename.

---------TECPLOT-------------------------------------------------

8.  Create an overall layout file for each interested variable and
    saved with an unique name in the subdirectory TecPlot/Layout.

9.  a) To create an animation interactively, Edit the paths in the macro file
         Create_Movie.mcr 

    b) To create an animation in batch mode, Edit the paths and data in the
       macro file
         Batch_Movie.mcr

10. a) To create figures interactively, Edit the paths in the macro file
         Create_Figure.mcr 

    b) To create figures in batch mode, Edit the paths and data in the
       macro file
         Batch_Figure.mcr

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The script files for preparing the data file for tecplot are

1.  goplot        Preplot the data .dat files into .plt files format and
                    move the data .dat files into the subdirectory Data.

2.  deletedat     Remove all .dat data files if the corresponding 
                  .plt files existed.

3.  reorder       Pad the .plt file with 0 for proper ordering 
                  when listed with ls command

4.  renumber      Link (ln) the .plt files in order and rename them to 
                  Flow_n.plt for processes with Tecplot marco in creating
                  movies or figures.

5.  Flow-List     Create a snapshot of the corresponding plt files and 
    Particle_List Flow_n.plt.

                  It will generate two script files Data_List and Flow_List 
                  which can be used to switch between the original plt filename
                  and Flow_n.plt filename and vice versa. 

                  Could be used in place of script   renumber  . 

6.  create-link   Create a symoblic link (ln) of each .plt files as Flow_n.plt 
                  after executed  script reorder.  

                  Could be used in place of script   renumber  . 

7.  create-rename Rename (mv)                    each .plt files as Flow_n.plt 
                  after executed  script reorder. 

                  Could be used in place of script   renumber  . 

                  Caution: It is impossible to regain the original .plt 
                           filename afterward.

--Addtional Information-----------------------------------------------------
Note : To start with numbering of the Flow_n.plt from the default number 1
       in scripts
         filelist, renumber, reorder, create-rename, create-link,
       appends an optional number n after the script such as 
         renumber n   .  

       For example, n=10,
         renumber 10
       would create an sequence of files in the order of 
         Flow_10.plt, Flow_11.plt, ...
       instead of the default files in the order of
         Flow_1.plt, Flow_2.plt......
